    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are used by various analytics applications to track how users
      behave on sites. We use Google Analytics to track our analytics. It
      allows us to see whether the site is used at all or not and how it is
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also use cookies to store session data, which includes and
      authorization key and you language settings. No personal data is
      stored in the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued use of the site is taken as implied permission to
      allow the use of cookies.

    <p>
      As stated, we only store your language preference and an authentication
      code (which changes every time you load the site) in your session. The
      session is valid for three months since you last accessed the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future we plan to add some personalization features to the site.
      However, none of the personalization data will be stored in the session
      on our servers. All personalization will be stored in your browser
      and will not work on another computer or different browser. Only the
      data required for the site to function will be sent to our servers and
      it will never be stored there.
